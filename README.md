My implementation of the [adventofcode 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), arguable the best advent calender on the internet :)

The goal is to use these little exercises to practice my pun and *Rust* skills, which are quite rusty at the moment.
I will keep a log of some thoughts on each exercise, about what I did and (mainly) learned.

Day 01
------
*Bin packing with three items => brute force.*

Just learning Rust using a nice [c++ to rust](https://github.com/nrc/r4cppp) tutorial.
Only at 4. yet, but you don't need to understand memory or pointers to write a simple program.
